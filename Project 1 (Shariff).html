  <h1>The Components of the World Wide Web</h1>
  <p>
    We use the internet everyday without giving it much thought, especially on
    how it works. The internet has these essential components shown below in
    order for it to work:

    <h2>Servers</h2>

    <b>Servers</b> are computers that serve one purpose: to transmit, or
    <i>serve</i> files over the Web. Many of the websites today
    are being put out there on the Web via these servers.

    <h2>Internet</h2>

    The <b>Internet</b> is a network of servers inter-connecting each other
    to form the <i>World Wide Web</i>.

    <h2>Browser</h2>

    In order for us to view a page from a website, a software known as a
    browser is needed. The browser decodes the files of any website, or a
    <i>webpage</i> and these pages are created using the code known as
    <b>HTML</b>, or <i>Hyper Text Mark Up Language</i>.

    <h2>HTTP</h2>

    <b>HTTP</b>, or  <i>HyperText Transfer Protocol</i>, is a computer
    communication protocol used for most communication on the Internet. It
    is a set of rules that conduct the client, i.e. web browser, and server
    interaction.

    <h2>HTML Elements</h2>

    For a html file to be displayed on the web browser, a computer language
    called HMTL, or <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>, is used. Inside of
    these files, we use codes known as the HTML elements, a set of <i>tags</i>
    which displays content on a web page. These elements consists of
    <i>closing</i> and an <i>opening</i> tags.

    <br>For example, to emboldened a text, we would use the &lt;b&gt;(opening)
    tag and &lt;/b&gt;(closing)tag like this: &lt;b&gt;<b>BOLD</b>&lt;/b&gt;
    Some tags do not require this tag: &lt;../&gt; -- a closing tag. These
    tags are known as <i>void</i> tags. These tags do not require closing tags
    since they can't contain content.

    <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>

    Some opening tags accepts additional values in them.These provides
    additonal information for the web browser. Two types of these attribute tags
    I learnt are the <i>Hyperlink</i> tag and the <i>image</i> tags.
    <br>A hyperlink tag looks like this: &lt;a href="http://www.Iknowalready.com"&gt;
    text here&lt;/a&gt;, where as the tags used to diplay images are like this
    one &lt;img src="image file name" alt="text"&gt;.

    <h2>Other Elements</h2>

    The other tags that I learnt in this course are:
    <br>1. &lt;P&gt;text&lt;/&gt;. This is called a <i>paragraph</i> tag.It
    creates a paragraph around the text.
    <br>2. &lt;br&gt;. This tag creates a line break in the text.
    <br>3. &lt;div&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;. This will create a 'box' element
    around the content.
    <br>4. &lt;span&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;. This tag an 'inline' box element.
